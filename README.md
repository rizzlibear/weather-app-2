this repo contains thw code for a simple weather display app which i made for practising my knowledge on basic api fetching, displaying the data which came through with the api, and managing states of various components.
on searching for the city name this site will display various weather parameters such as temp,wind speed,humidity i have done that using usestate hook to dynamically change the component 
whenever the submit button is pressed it fires the useeffect and it call the api to get the data for the city entered.
